### Key Files

- **App.js**: Main component with the app's core functionality
- **app.json**: Expo configuration including app name, icons, and platform settings
- **package.json**: Project dependencies and scripts

## üé® Customization

### Food Recognition & Nutrition Analysis
The app now uses Google Gemini AI for enhanced food recognition with these capabilities:
- **High-Accuracy Identification**: Gemini's advanced vision model identifies foods with greater precision
- **Smart Portion Estimation**: AI analyzes portion sizes and provides realistic nutritional estimates
- **Comprehensive Nutrition**: Get calories, carbs, protein, and fat content for each food item
- **Unknown Food Handling**: Even foods not in the database get intelligent nutritional estimates
- **Multiple Food Detection**: Analyze complex meals with multiple food items

### Styling
The app uses React Native's StyleSheet for styling with:
- Modern color scheme
- Clean typography
- Consistent spacing
- Subtle shadows and elevations

### Adding Features
This is a basic starter template. You can extend it by:
- Adding navigation with React Navigation
- Integrating with APIs
- Adding more screens and components
- Including state management (Redux, Context API)

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **expo**: Expo SDK for React Native
- **react**: React library
- **react-native**: React Native framework
- **expo-status-bar**: Status bar management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Gemini AI Setup
The app uses Google Gemini AI for food recognition. The API key is configured in `foodAnalysisService.js`:

```javascript
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
```

**Important**: For production deployment, consider using environment variables to keep your API key secure:
- Use Expo's environment variables system
- Or implement a secure server-side proxy for API calls
- Never commit API keys to version control

## üîß Scripts

- `npm start`: Start Expo development server
- `npm run android`: Run on Android emulator
- `npm run ios`: Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
- `npm run web`: Run in web browser
