# Affiliate System Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Core+ app now includes a comprehensive affiliate/influencer system that allows tracking of referral codes, commission calculation, and future dashboard development.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Frontend Changes**

#### OnboardingStep4_Summary.js
- âœ… Replaced summary section with affiliate code input
- âœ… Auto-converts input to uppercase to reduce errors

### 2. **Backend/Database**

#### Supabase Tables Created (supabase_affiliate_system.sql)

**`influencers` table:**
- Stores influencer/affiliate partner information
- Fields: name, email, affiliate_code, commission_rate, social media links
- Tracks total referrals and earnings
- Configurable commission rates (percentage or fixed amount)

**`affiliate_usage` table:**
- Tracks when users use affiliate codes
- Links users to influencers
- Records signup completion and subscription status
- Calculates commission eligibility and amounts
- Prevents duplicate usage by same user

**`commission_payouts` table:**
- Records commission payments to influencers
- Tracks payout history and status
- References specific affiliate usage records
- Supports multiple payment methods

#### Database Features:
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- âœ… Automated stats updating via triggers
- âœ… Helper functions for code validation
- âœ… Performance indexes
- âœ… Sample data for testing

### 3. **Services**

#### affiliateService.js
- âœ… `validateAffiliateCode()` - Checks if code exists and is active
- âœ… `recordAffiliateUsage()` - Records when user uses a code during signup
- âœ… `updateSubscriptionStatus()` - Updates commission eligibility when user subscribes
- âœ… `getUserAffiliateUsage()` - Gets affiliate usage for specific user
- âœ… `getAllInfluencers()` - Admin function to get all influencers

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. **Run the Database Setup**
```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase_affiliate_system.sql
```

### 2. **Test the System**
1. Complete the onboarding flow with an affiliate code
2. Check the `affiliate_usage` table to see the recorded usage
3. Verify that invalid codes are handled gracefully

### 3. **Future Dashboard Development**

#### Influencer Dashboard Features:
- **Analytics**: Show referral counts, conversion rates, earnings
- **Performance**: Track clicks, signups, and subscription conversions
- **Payouts**: View payout history and pending commissions
- **Marketing Materials**: Download promotional assets
- **Real-time Stats**: Live updates on referral performance

#### Admin Dashboard Features:
- **Influencer Management**: Add/edit/deactivate influencers
- **Commission Management**: Approve/process payouts
- **Analytics**: Overall program performance
- **Code Management**: Generate and manage affiliate codes

### 4. **Integration with Subscription System**
When you implement subscriptions, call:
```javascript
import { affiliateService } from './services/affiliateService';

// When user starts subscription
await affiliateService.updateSubscriptionStatus(
  userId, 
  subscriptionPlan, 
  subscriptionAmount
);
```

### 5. **Commission Calculation Logic**
The system supports:
- **Percentage commissions** (default 10%)
- **Fixed amount commissions**
- **Different rates per influencer**
- **Automatic calculation when subscription starts**

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### Sample Affiliate Codes (included in SQL)
- `FITNESSMIKE` (15% commission)
- `HEALTHYHANNAH` (12% commission)  
- `STRONGSARAH` (10% commission)

### Key Functions Available
```sql
-- Validate a code
SELECT public.validate_affiliate_code('FITNESSMIKE');

-- Get influencer by code
SELECT public.get_influencer_by_code('FITNESSMIKE');
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Commission Rates
- Set in `influencers.commission_rate` (decimal, e.g., 0.10 = 10%)
- Can be percentage or fixed amount per `commission_type`

### Payment Methods
- PayPal
- Stripe
- Bank Transfer

### Security
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
- Admin role required for management functions
- Secure functions for code validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Potential

The system tracks:
- **Signup conversions**: Users who complete onboarding with code
- **Subscription conversions**: Users who upgrade to paid plans
- **Commission amounts**: Calculated based on subscription value
- **Referral sources**: Track signup vs renewal vs upgrade
- **Time-based analytics**: When codes are used most effectively

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features

### Affiliate Code Input
- **Auto-uppercase**: Prevents case sensitivity errors
- **Optional field**: Doesn't block onboarding if not provided
- **Clear messaging**: Users understand it's for influencer codes
- **Consistent styling**: Matches rest of onboarding flow

### Error Handling
- Invalid codes don't prevent signup completion
- Clear logging for debugging affiliate issues
- Graceful fallbacks if affiliate service is down

This system provides a solid foundation for influencer partnerships and can be expanded with more advanced features like:
- Tiered commission structures
- Bonus thresholds
- Custom landing pages per influencer
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Automated payout systems
