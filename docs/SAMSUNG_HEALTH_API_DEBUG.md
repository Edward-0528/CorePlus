# Samsung Health API Investigation and Fixes

## Issue Analysis

The error `SamsungHealth.authorize is not a function` indicates that the react-native-samsung-health library structure is different than expected.

## Debugging Steps Implemented

### 1. Import Investigation
Added debugging to see what the Samsung Health library actually exports:
```javascript
console.log('Available methods:', Object.keys(SamsungHealth || {}));
console.log('Type:', typeof SamsungHealth);
```

### 2. Multiple API Pattern Support
The service now tries multiple common patterns:
- `SamsungHealth.requestPermissions(permissions)`
- `SamsungHealth.authorize(permissions)`
- `SamsungHealth.connect()`
- Fallback to mock permissions if none work

### 3. Default Export Handling
Some libraries export as `{ default: actualLibrary }`:
```javascript
if (SamsungHealth && SamsungHealth.default) {
  SamsungHealth = SamsungHealth.default;
}
```

## Common Samsung Health Library Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Methods
```javascript
SamsungHealth.authorize(permissions)
SamsungHealth.initialize()
```

### Pattern 2: Default Export
```javascript
const { default: SamsungHealth } = require('react-native-samsung-health');
```

### Pattern 3: Named Exports
```javascript
const { authorize, initialize } = require('react-native-samsung-health');
```

### Pattern 4: Class-based
```javascript
const SamsungHealthClass = require('react-native-samsung-health');
const samsungHealth = new SamsungHealthClass();
```

## Current Implementation Strategy

1. **Debug the actual library structure** first
2. **Try multiple API patterns** to find the working one
3. **Graceful fallback** to mock data if all APIs fail
4. **Comprehensive logging** to understand what's available

## Expected Console Output

When you test now, you should see:
```
Samsung Health imported successfully
Available methods: [array of available methods]
Type: object (or function)
```

This will help us understand the correct API to use!

## Next Steps

After seeing the debug output, we can:
1. Identify the correct method names
2. Update the service to use the proper API
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Test on real Samsung device

## Fallback Strategy

If Samsung Health continues to have issues:
- Use mock data for development
- Focus on core app functionality
- Samsung Health can be optional feature
- Real testing requires Samsung device anyway
