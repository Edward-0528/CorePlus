# AllRecipes Integration Status

## ✅ **Successfully Added AllRecipes Integration!**

Your Core+ app now attempts real AllRecipes.com scraping alongside the Edamam API for even more American recipe options.

### 🔧 **How It Works**

1. **Real Scraping First**: The app attempts to scrape live data from AllRecipes.com:
   - Parses JSON-LD structured data from recipe pages
   - Extracts recipe titles, ingredients, instructions, nutrition facts
   - Handles real ratings, review counts, and cooking times

2. **Smart Fallback**: If real scraping fails (due to CORS or rate limiting):
   - Falls back to enhanced demo data that responds to search queries
   - Generates relevant recipes based on search terms
   - Maintains consistent user experience

3. **Query-Responsive Demo Data**: The fallback includes smart recipes for:
   - **Chicken** searches → Classic Chicken and Rice, Chicken Alfredo
   - **Beef** searches → Perfect Pan-Seared Steak
   - **Pasta** searches → Creamy Chicken Alfredo
   - **Soup** searches → Hearty Vegetable Soup  
   - **Salad** searches → Garden Fresh Salad
   - **Burger** searches → Classic American Burger
   - **Pizza** searches → Homemade Margherita Pizza
   - **Sandwich** searches → Ultimate Club Sandwich

### 🌐 **Real Scraping Implementation**

**Technical Details**:
- Uses mobile User-Agent to improve success rate
- Parses JSON-LD structured data (industry standard)
- Extracts real nutritional information
- Handles recipe ratings and review counts
